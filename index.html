				<p>
					Air quality index (AQI) is used to indicate the levels of the criteria pollutants in the air. The overall AQI
                 is the maximum of the AQI recorded for the individual criteria pollutants. AQI levels also indicate the health risks 
                 associated with exposure to the particular air quality.

							The quality of water has a direct influence on both human health and the environment. Water is utilized for a variety of purposes, including drinking, agriculture, and industrial use. The water quality index (WQI) is a critical indication for proper water management

                            decline in soil quality interrupts primary soil functions and may hamper crop production and food security. However, soil quality evaluation is necessary for identifying areas with corresponding high and low soil quality, and their suitability for agricultural land use in general and cultivated crops in particular.
